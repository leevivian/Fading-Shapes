# Fading-Shapes

This Android Application uses buttons to trigger drawing shapes on a Relative Layout. As new shapes are added, the previously drawn shapes fade away. Shapes are drawn with a style, and styles are defined by a combination of a border color and a fill color.

Shapes are drawn as randomly sized rectangles and circles. A STYLE button has been added that will allow the user to change styles. When this button is pressed, the next style is chosen. The button loops back around to the start of the list of styles. Pressing the CLEAR button removes all shapes from the canvas. A count of the number of each type of shape is displayed at the top of the screen, as well as the name of the next style to be created.
